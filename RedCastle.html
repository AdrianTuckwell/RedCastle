  <p class="large-text">Welcome to Redcastle!</p>

  <p>
    You find yourself driving along the shore road on the Beauly Firth. The year is 1957, and it's approaching midnight.
    The rain pours down as darkness engulfs the surroundings. You're behind the wheel of a Standard Motor Company model Ten car, navigating
    the treacherous weather.
  </p>

  <p>
    As you round a bend, your car suddenly splutters and comes to a halt. You attempt to restart it, but the engine
    refuses to cooperate. Frustration sets in as you realize you're stranded in the middle of nowhere.
  </p>

  <p>
    You step out of the car into the stormy night, the rain beating down upon you. With a sense of urgency, you scan
    your surroundings, searching for any sign of help or shelter.
  </p>

  <p>
    Prepare to embark on a thrilling adventure, where every decision you make will shape your destiny. Will you find a
    way to escape this predicament and unravel the mysteries that lie ahead? The choice is yours...
